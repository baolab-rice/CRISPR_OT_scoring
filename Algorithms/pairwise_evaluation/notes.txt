TrueOT_v1_1_allscores.xlsx is TreuOT supplemented with baseline algorithms' raw scores on all viable datapoints in TrueOT. If no output is listed for a particular baseline algorithm on a particular datapoint, it means that datapoint could not be evaluated by the baseline (e.g., a bulge datapoint with a mismatch-only algorithm).

To reproduce pairwise comparison results: 
+ baseline_overlap.py evaluates which gRNAs in the training sets of various baselines are in TrueOT and flags them for exclusion (output file:  TrueOT_v1_1_gRNA_overlap.xlsx)
+ overlap_mask_confirm.py merges the flagged gRNAs with the ''_allscores.xlsx file to generate exclusion masks for pairwise comparisons (output file: TrueOT_v1_1_rawmasks.xlsx)
+ pairwise_compare.py uses the ''_rawmasks.xlsx and the ''_allscores.xlsx along with the saved S1C ensemble to conduct pairwise comparisons. 

**Using these files prevents any reording of the TrueOT excel data from throwing off the masks for pairwise comparisons**
