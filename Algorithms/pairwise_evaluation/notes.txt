TrueOTlist_1008_extended_aligned_upto12MM_v10.xlsx is the TrueOT dataset
TrueOText_v10+allscores_format.xlsx contains the raw output of various scoring algorithms
custom_scoring\parsed_datasets\TrueOT\20-11-07_trueOTv10_ext_origInd.pkl is the pre-parsed TrueOT dataset in the same order

**Using these files prevents any reording of the TrueOT excel data from throwing off the masks for pairwise comparisons**

can run pairwise_compare.py to regenerate pairwise results 


21-05-26_trueOTv10_indelMask.pkl is a stored mask of which trueOT datapoints have bulges (indels) between the guideRNA and OT 
- again, this mask order matches the file list above.

'Net_ori' is CRISPR-NET with original alignment information

We tried some initial experiments with multiple alignment techniques (regex and CRISTA's custom method (Abadi et al)) 
- but our published results solely rely on the original alignment information to avoid adding another confounding variable
